Two Weeks in writing 250 words a day
====================================

:date: 2016-09-12T20:26

`Two weeks ago I started writing at least 250 words a day
<{filename}20160829-first.rst>`_. It's been a challenging fourteen days, each
day trying to find something I could ramble on for 250 words. Some posts were a
real slog, as I either couldn't decide on a topic or didn't have the desire to
reach the target word count. Some were easy — almost too easy — and needed to be
reined in to stay on topic.

The toughest post (after this one) was probably about `my long-term relationship with
Apple <{filename}20160907-apple-history.rst>`_. How was I able to squeeze out
250 words on Apple crap I've owned? That's 62 words on each Apple product!

The easiest post was likely `the photowalk that almost was my
last <{filename}20160906-last-photowalk.rst>`_. It was also fun weaving a small
narrative with a little bit of tension. I'd write more like that just to try
and create an interesting story from an everyday happening.

I may not be able to continue writing 250 words a day on a different topic
forever. I haven't set a goal yet. I think a month is a good start. That would
provide at least 7500 words — about as much as for a novelette.

If I can carry this on for a month, I feel I may find it easier to commit to
250 words every day, or I may exhaust the easier topics until at some point I
am forced to yammer on about quantum mechanics. I haven't yet resorted to
drawing a topic out of a hat. It's not beneath me.
